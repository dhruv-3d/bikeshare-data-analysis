# bikeshare-data-analysis
### The file **bikeshare.py** is the main file which you need to look at.
```
python3 bikeshare.py
```

The other resource I used for solving the task is the official documentation of pandas
(https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html)

Aside from this, to make the task more fun, I was learning the **[Dash Framework](https://plot.ly/products/dash/)** on my own and thought I could convert this task into a simple web application using Dash, so I did!
This enabled me to get the basic idea ofthe how we can use data and can make visualization to gain insights from, still I have much to learn.
WebApp deployed to Heroku:  https://dash-app-plotly.herokuapp.com
